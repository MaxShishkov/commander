The Commander is a class that extends JFrame.
The commander contains a jTextField that takes an input from the user and passes it to the string called command.
It also has a JComboBox that contains three choices that determine the rate and pitch of speech synthesizer. The combo box also determines the context of two helper strings "helper" and "finisher".
The last component of the frame is the Speak button. The speak button passes the variable strings helper, command and finisher to the Talk class's variable called the speaker.
